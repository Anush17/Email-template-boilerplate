# Email template boilerplate

##Free Responsive Email Templates.
The email boilerplate for sending out nicely formatted messages.

#####An email template can be described as:
A reusable HTML file that is used to build email campaigns.
Each template is responsive, fully customizable, and can be edited and optimized for your brand.


Using an email template allows you to produce campaigns faster, since the underlying code is already written. Instead of having to rewrite an entire email from scratch for every send, you can simply add copy, images, and links to an existing template before testing and sending it to your subscribers.
